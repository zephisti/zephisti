# 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Lawrence

🎯 **HR Innovator | AI Consultant | Builder of Fairer Systems**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a multidisciplinary professional exploring the intersection of **human resources**, **AI**, and **creative tech**. I use this space to build, test, and share projects that combine technical experimentation with real-world impact.

## 🧠 What I’m Interested In

- **Generative AI in HR** — I’m passionate about building tools that promote **fair, unbiased, and contextually relevant** decision-making in hiring and talent management.
- **Contextual Relevance Scoring (CRS)** — My research and projects focus on scoring systems that evaluate resumes and job descriptions beyond keywords, with an emphasis on fairness and transparency.
- **AI-powered SaaS Tools** — I build lightweight tools for **HR automation**, **bias detection**, and **workflow optimization**.
- **Creative Web Projects** — From React dashboards to pixel-art clicker games, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through intuitive UIs and modular design.
- **Documentation & SOP Tools** — I love simplifying complex processes using **prompt libraries**, **smart SOPs**, and **automated survey analysis**.

## 🕹️ When I’m Not Coding…

You’ll find me deep in **strategy RPGs, idle clicker games**, or theorycrafting mechanics for browser-based games. I’m especially into:

- **World of Warcraft (Idle style fan projects)**
- **Diablo II-inspired loot systems**
- **Management & builder games** with automation and progression systems

I often blend my love for games into my work — think **gamified dashboards**, **pixel art UIs**, and **progression-based learning tools**.
